1. Take the SQLs in the file under database folder
   create a database and execute the scripts there
2. If you want to track visits (IP) for each of your web-sites. Keep history of the IPs that were sent to a particular web-site.
   you will need one database table for that. You can keep all IPs for all sites in the same table as well.
3. Ad this block to the pages where you want full page view advertisements - on the web-site where ads will be shown

<?php
	if ($_GET['isCampaign']!="1"){
		require_once 'geo.php';
	}
?>

4. In the file geo.php (at the root of the site - the site where ads will be shown)
   Change the value of interval in milli seconds. If you want to display ad in every 60 minutes, set it to 60000 (will confirm on this soon)

  if ( abs($currentTime-$accessed) >= $interval ){
  }

ideally you do not want to show ads on every visit to the site by the same user. By using this interval for a particular visitor/IP the ad will be shown once
in every $interval period.

5. You will need to copy the folders geo and the file geo.php to the site where you want to display ads. You can use a common geo.php and geo folder for all of
your own sites.

6. If you want to resale others' traffic - you can create or reuse the files under the campaign folder. Currently, these campaigns load sites based on country (your clients' country as
you entered/stored (through Add-Websites interface) in the database  )
